# Pending work and handoffs

This folder holds durable continuation notes for work that spans agent sessions.
Start with the relevant handoff, then inspect the current source and Git status.

| Handoff | State |
| --- | --- |
| [New / Review study flow](study-handoff.md) | Implemented and committed. All shipped HSK 1-6 study behavior is included in the passing Pages suite. The separate all-seven-band authoring audit remains blocked by missing HSK 7-9 examples. |
| [Assistant, voices, and profiles](assistant-handoff.md) | YAML replies were pushed as `a941fe7c`; Pages run `36514703900` succeeded. Profile-wide pinyin formats are implemented and validated; commit, push, and deployment verification requested. Settings changes update existing displays without rewriting pronunciation; the user's local files and template generator select marks plus numbers. |

## Maintaining this folder

- Update the existing handoff when work advances instead of creating competing snapshots.
- Record decisions, exact remaining work, important files, and commands/results.
- Distinguish implemented code from reviewed or validated behavior.
- Verify that any previously running agent has finished before editing its files.
- Never copy credentials, private settings contents, or user conversation data here.
- When work is finished, update its status and record any remaining follow-up.

The root `AGENTS.md` points future agents here. These files are ordinary repository
documentation, not a replacement for inspecting the current working tree.
